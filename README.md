# Wealthfront 
## Overview and Origin[^1]
Wealthfront (originally named kaChing[^5]) is considered a "Robo-Advisor" company that invests customers funds in primarily-US investment securities through automated means without individual Financial Advisors meeting with the customers or guiding individual investments. 

Wealthfront was founded by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in December of 2008. According to the founders, the idea for Wealthfront came from their shared experiences that financial advisors often had two issues that affected smaller investors:
1. Advisors had significant minimum investment balances that prevented students or younger professionals from utilizing their services when they most needed them (when compound growth rates would be most beneficial).

2. Advisors often focused 90% of their attention on their top 20% balance holders as they generated most of their income.
Both Dan and Andy had experiences with friends or family that financial advisors were not properly serving smaller customers to their detriment during market downturns.

After the 2008 financial crisis began and his parents were hurt financially, Dan Carroll had begun to develop software that would provide financial advisory services to more people at lower cost. As the positive talk spread about Dan's software, Andy Rachleff convinced Dan that he could assist with growing it into an impactful company. Andy had already partially retired as a successful venture capitalist and was lecturing at Stanford.

Wealthfront first raised $3 million of investment in 2008 and has since raised six additional rounds of investment for $274.2MM of total investments.[^2] In 2022, UBS  entered into an acquisition agreement with Wealthfront. However, both sides decided to terminate that agreement amicably with UBS investing $69.7 million, which valued Wealthfront at $1.4 billion and marked Wealthfront as a "Unicorn" (privately-held startup over $1 billion in valuation).[^3] Unspecified regulatory concerns were cited as the motivation for not completing the acquisition.


## Business Activities[^1]:
Wealthfront is primarily focused on holding customer funds and investing them in customizable areas:
- US Stocks ETFs (Exchange Traded investment Funds)
- Commodity ETFs
- Bond ETFs
- Foreign / Emerging Market ETFs
- Other more focused ETFs (socially responsible, tech, sectors)
- Cryptocurrency Trusts
- Individual Stocks (new, March 2023)

Wealthfront has three types of accounts:
- General Investing - to build wealth for general use
- Retirement - funds for use after 60 years of age
- Education - funding college or other qualified expenses

Based on the input of customers, Wealthfront will modify the investment strategy based on risk tolerance. After the account is funded and invested across their recommended categories, Wealthfront will strategically continue to trade and rebalance your portfolio to maintain risk and take profit while utilizing losses to minimize taxes.

In exchange for these services, Wealthfront charges a 0.25% annual fee of assets under management (AUM). They do not charge commissions on individual stocks traded.

Wealthfront is primarily targeting tech-literate millennials and young professionals who would like to "set it and forget it".[^4] 90% of Wealthfront customers are under 45 years of age. There are over 116 million people between 18 and 44 in the US (~35.6% of US population). As of March 2023, Wealthfront has over 550,000 customers and $35 billion of assets under management.

## Landscape

Wealthfront is in the larger industry of investment advisory services and more specifically, Robo-Advising.[^4] Robo-advising firms, as a segment of that industry, provide automated financial planning and investment services without human interaction. The website requests goals and risk tolerance from the customer and customizes investments to those answers.

Robo-Advising has seen huge growth rates since inception with 2017-2023 user rate growing 5X per Statista.[^7] Statista is predicting a 14% CAGR for Robo-Advising over the period of 2023-2027. They also estimate $2.7 trillion AUM for the segment in 2023. That would place Wealthfront as only 1.3% of the segment's assets under management.

Robo-advising has not substantially changed since being started in the early 2010's, but larger legacy financial advisory companies have begun to offer the service as they have lost customers to Robo-Advisory firms. The large full-service firms have generally elected to create their own services in lieu of acquiring firms. There is one exception: Personal Capital Advisors (~75% the size to Wealthfront) was purchased by Empower Retirement, which no longer advertises Robo-Advisory services. 

Over time, the Robo-Advisor startup firms are beginning to look more like online brokers as they offer more cash account and individual stock trading services. 

## Results

Wealthfront is one of a few Fintech Robo-Advisor startups in the late 2000's that created a strong market presence over its fifteen years of existence. They have reached a small, but significant market share and forced the legacy industry to offer similar services in response to market demand for automated, low-cost financial advisory services. 

When compared to other Robo-Advisor firms M1 and Betterment, Wealthfront does not appear to have any clear advantage nor clear disadvantage. Their fees appear to be comparable (~0.25% annually of AUM). Additionally, they compete against full-service firms offering Robo-Advisor services (Vanguard charges ~0.25% annually of AUM, Schwab charges ~1.4% annually of AUM), which have large existing customer bases to whom they can cross-sell.

Overall, Wealthfront is competing well with the other startup Robo-Advisor firms M1 and Betterment. However, they have fallen behind to the legacy firms who have implemented their own Robo-Advisors. Customer loyalty (and/or cost of switching firms) appears to be high.

## Recommendations

I would recommend that Wealthfront take these strategic actions:
- Cut their asset management fee by a small fraction to lure away customers from startup and legacy firms and be the firm of first choice for new customers entering the segment.

    - Wealthfront needs clear differentiation from competitors.

- Move to become a total cash/savings/investment platform for millennials & Gen Z. Provide all services from receiving paychecks, bill payments, automatic savings towards a 6-month emergency fund, debt consolidation (student, credit card, etc. loans), and savings/investing for future cars, houses, education, and retirement. The goal is to take the worry from customers' finances. I would recommend the "Debt Waterfall" and  "Savings Waterfall" concepts that would match well with systematic, automatic money management.

    - Wealthfront needs clear differentiation from competitors.
    
    - I believe this would distinguish them from startup and legacy competitors which are providing on very siloed solutions.

    - This would not require any new types of technology, but obviously a great deal of internal development to build this framework and marketing to create interest and ease around the concept.
